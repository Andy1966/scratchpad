This directory contained all the tested videos. 

As I do not want to distribute video which is why this directory is empty. So simply download any video and put the name into the videoProperties.ini file. With what I show here I used the clipcanvas_14348.mp4 video and then copied renaming as 1..5 so I had size videos to test with. 

I googled free video and found https://www.veedybox.com/blog/32-resources-for-free-stock-videos/ and found https://coverr.co/ where I downloaded free videos for testing.
